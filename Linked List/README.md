# 🔗 Linked List Operations

A C program to perform various operations on a linked list, including insertion, deletion, and traversal!

## 📜 Description

This project is a beginner-friendly C program that allows you to perform various operations on a linked list, such as inserting nodes at the beginning, end, or a specific index, deleting nodes from the beginning, end, or a specific index, and traversing the linked list to print its elements.

### Example:
```
Select The Operation You Want To Perform
 1. Traversal of Linked List
 2. Insertion at Beginning
 3. Insertion at End
 4. Insertion at Index
 5. Deletion at Beginning
 6. Deletion at End
 7. Deletion at Index
 8. Exit
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C compiler (e.g., GCC) installed on your system

### How to Run

#### On Linux:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone --depth 1 --filter=blob:none --sparse https://github.com/aditya-kr86/DSA_College_Practice.git
   cd DSA_College_Practice
   git sparse-checkout set "Linked List"
   ```
2. Navigate to the Linked List directory:
   ```bash
   cd Linked\ List/
   ```
3. Compile the program:
   ```bash
   gcc linked_list.c -o linked_list
   ```
4. Run the executable:
   ```bash
   ./linked_list
   ```

#### On Windows:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone --depth 1 --filter=blob:none --sparse https://github.com/aditya-kr86/DSA_College_Practice.git
   cd DSA_College_Practice
   git sparse-checkout set "Linked List"
   ```
2. Navigate to the Linked List directory:
   ```bash
   cd "Linked List"
   ```
3. Compile the program using a C compiler (e.g., GCC):
   ```bash
   gcc linked_list.c -o linked_list
   ```
4. Run the executable:
   ```bash
   linked_list.exe
   ```

## 📦 Features

- Insert nodes at the beginning, end, or a specific index
- Delete nodes from the beginning, end, or a specific index
- Traverse and print the elements of the linked list

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **C** - for implementing the logic

## 💡 Ideas for Improvement

- Add more operations such as reversing the linked list.
- Implement input validation to handle incorrect inputs.
- Create a graphical user interface (GUI) for better user experience.
